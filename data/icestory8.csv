"<p>The ice plant is a rhizomatic plant, which means that it has an underground stem that runs horizontally beneath the ground, able to produce new shoots and roots from its nodes.</p>",1980
"<p>An individual plant can grow more than three feet in diameter in one year.</p>",1983
"<p>Where ice plant grows on dunes, its growth forms dense mats that restrict the natural movement of sand, which most native dune species need.</p>",1986
"<p>One such species, the Bank Swallow, nests within the dunes. On March 3, 1989 the Bank Swallow is listed as endangered.<img src='../img/bankswallowl.png'></p>",1989
