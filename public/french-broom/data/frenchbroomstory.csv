"<p>French Broom is indigenous to the Mediterranean, and was first introduced to California in the 1850s. The stems were used as materials for making brooms.</p>",1976
"<p>It is listed by the California Invasive Plant Council as one of the most invasive and widespread wildland pest plants in California.</p>",1981

"<p>The plant changes microclimate conditions at the soil level. As a member of the Fabaceae family, French Broom is capable of fixing Nitrogen from the atmosphere through its roots, which allows the the plant to grow in otherwise poor conditions.</p>",1989

"<p>The presence of French Broom was found to have reduced Arthropod biodiversity in the Golden Gate Recreational Area by one third. (Lanford and Nelson, Park Science, Spring Issue. Washington DC, USA: National Park Service.)</p>",1998
"<p>It is highly flammable, and carries fire to the canopy layer, increasing intensity and frequency of fires. Studies have indicated that heat increases germination of seeds, allowing French Broom to flourish after a fire.</p>",2001
"<p>As of 2000, French Broom occupied more than 100,000 acres of land in California.</p>",2006
"<p>French Broom seeds and foliage are toxic, and can cause cause staggering followed by paralysis in some species of livestock. Horses can experience digestive disorders when consuming the leaves of the plant.</p>",2010

"<p>French Broom is edging out native coastal scrub plants such as Coyote Brush. A study of Coyote Brush conducted in 1951 identified over 221 species of insects associated with it. In turn, the insects hosted another 62 species of parasites. A loss of the Coyote Brush spells drastic changes for the larger ecosystem.</p>",2014
