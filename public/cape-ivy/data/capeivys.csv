"The plant grows tenaciously in wetlands and streams, smothering native plants and often dominating the riparian understory. Under the right conditions, it may also spread into a forest understory, shrub thickets and grasslands. ",1971,,,,,

"The endangered Least Bell’s Vireo (Vireo bellii pusillus) favors riparian habitat with a dense, mugwortdominated understory (Wood et al. 2006). ",1982,,,,,
"River Partners restored such habitat in the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge (SJRNWR) as part of a large-scale riparian restoration project that continues to this day. Happily, Least Bell’s Vireos were observed breeding successfully in this habitat at SJRNWR in 2005 and 2006, the first such occurrence in over 60 years.'",1986,,,,,
"The vine tends to form a thick carpet and is considered poisonous. Preliminary research has indicated a toxicity to aquatic organisms.",1988,,,,,

"<p>The California populations of cape ivy produce little viable seed. Nonetheless, the plant is still very difficult to control because of its ability to resprout from small fragments. Any fragments left behind after removal can result in a reinfestation.</p>",2003,,,,,

"Notably, the plant is not a dominant understory species in South Africa. This implies that there are control mechanisms that keep the vine in check in its native range.",2008,,,,,
