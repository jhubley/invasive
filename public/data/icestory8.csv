"<p><img src='../img/iceplant.png'>Native to South Africa, Iceplant was brought to California in the late 19th century and used during the construction of the Continental Railroad to stabilize soil next to railroad tracks.</p>",1864
"<p>While developing the highway system, Caltrans also used iceplant to shore up soil along roads.</p>",1959
"<p>Up until the 1970â€™s, thousands of acres were planted. <img src='../img/icesantacruz2.png'></p>",1978
"<p>The ice plant is a rhizomatic plant, meaning it has an underground stem that runs horizontally beneath the ground, able to produce new shoots and roots from its nodes.</p>",1980
"<p>Peter Connors, a botanist with the UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory, has noted ""It sends runners out over the surface and it will cover over all the surrounding grassland, and exclude everything else. It's almost a total loss of whatever plant community was there in the first place.""</p>",1983
"<p>An individual plant can grow more than three feet in diameter in one year.</p>",1985
"<p>Where ice plant grows on dunes, its growth forms dense mats that restrict the natural movement of sand, which most native dune species need.</p>",1986
"<p>One such species, the Bank Swallow, nests within the dunes. On March 3, 1989 the Bank Swallow was listed as endangered.<img src='../img/bankswallow.png'></p>",1989
"The dense mats, in addition to a higher soil salinity credited to ice plant, push out native plants as well.",1992
"<p>By 1994, Indian Clover in the Bay Area was nearly all gone.<br/><img src='../img/indianclover.png'></p>",1994

"<p>The Bank Swallow (Riparia riparia), 'North America's smallest swallow, nests on near-vertical banks and cliffs. At Ft. Funston, ice plant had overgrown most of the seaside cliff faces, disrupting the bank swallow's habitat.' (LA Times, 5/4/2002)</p>",2003

"<p>In 1993, Snowy Plover was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.<img src='../img/snowyplover.png'></p>",2010
"<p>The Snowy Plover's plight is correlated with that of Pink Sand Verbena.<br/><img src='../img/pinksandverbena.png'></p>",2012
"<p>Pink Sand Verbena blossoms were First collected on a scientific expedition to California in 1786, Pink Sand Verbena was the first California native plant to be collected and described.<br/>Now, due to habitat destruction and exotic invasives such as Ice Plant, Pink Sand Verbena is endangered.</p>",2014
