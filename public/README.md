# Invasive Ricochet
Invasive Ricochet explores how invasive plant species affect Bay Area ecosystems. Focusing on a select number of case studies, I have created narratives of the struggle between native plants and the invasive plants that are displacing them.
It was developed over the summer of 2015 while I was a Creative Code Fellow at the Gray Area Foundation for the Arts and was installed at Gray Area in August. This repo includes Arduino code used for capacitive touch sensors. There's also some node.js written to translate the onscreen data to LEDs (higher species occurence = brighter lights) via websocket. This didn't end up getting used at the installation in August. To run this project on the web, just use the /public folder and comment out references to socket.io
